// day × campaign × adset × ad × micromarket, collapsed to one SellerSpendFact per
// (day × channel × micromarket × raw source). Shared by scripts/build-seller-spend.ts and,
// if the sheet ever becomes a live read, by that reader too.
//
// Deliberately a sibling of lib/buyer/spend/parse.ts rather than a shared generic: the two
// tabs agree on their column headers and on nothing else. They differ in date order (D/M here
// vs M/D there), channel taxonomy, valid micromarket list, and what an unrecognised
// micromarket means. Only the format primitives are shared, via lib/spend/sheet.ts.
//
// Columns are matched by NORMALISED HEADER TEXT, never position — the growth team adds and
// reorders columns. A missing required header is a hard, named error, because guessing by
// position is how you chart Impressions as Spends.
