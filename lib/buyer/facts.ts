// The fact table. One row per lead, visit, conversion and live house, each carrying
// every dimension the filters can slice on: time, cluster, micromarket, channel.
//
// Facts are already filtered for eligibility, so nothing downstream has to re-apply those
// rules and no card can forget to. Filtered here: the VCV test cluster; the Channel
// Partner / Builder / Seller Referral / NoBroker / Society Partners lead sources; leads
// whose every micromarket is virtual; visits at a virtual micromarket; and Channel-
// Partner-sourced BIDS, which drop their own visit, warm flag and conversion while
// leaving the lead behind them in the population.
//
// The one rule NOT applied here is phone identity — LeadFact rows are not merged, because
// drill-downs need the real Zoho record. Instead each row carries `dedupKey`/`isPrimary`
// and derive.ts counts on those.
//
// Cluster and micromarket are ARRAYS. Truva_Cluster and Truva_Micromarket are both
// multiselect picklists in Zoho, and a lead carrying two micromarkets counts under
// both. Per-micromarket columns therefore sum to more than the unfiltered total.
